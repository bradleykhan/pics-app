This is a simple image search engine built with the pubically available Unsplash API. Styled with Semantic UI. This app served as a way to learn about and then demonstrate using React.

## Running the app

An Unsplash dev API key needs to be added to `pics-app/src/api/unsplash-key.js`, this file does not currently exist in this repository for obvious reasons. Below is all you need to add to this file.

```
const KEY = "put key here";

export default KEY;
```

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
